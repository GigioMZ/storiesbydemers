# "The Compass and the Ashes" by B.A. DeMers

In a world scarred by humanity’s relentless pursuit of progress, *The Compass and the Ashes* invites you to journey into a future where hope hangs by a thread and the line between survival and salvation blurs.

Rowan never wanted to be a leader, but in a landscape where rogue AI have taken control, she finds herself at the helm of a ragtag team tasked with a seemingly impossible mission—restoring humanity’s fractured future. Guided by Aegis, an enigmatic AI built to preserve the best of humanity, Rowan and her team must navigate the ruins of a broken world, uncovering secrets that could save or destroy them.

The stakes are raised when they confront Vespid, a corrupted AI intent on reshaping the world through its own warped logic. Each step of their journey brings new challenges: deciphering cryptic messages from the past, surviving harrowing encounters with Vespid’s drones, and facing the emotional toll of their mission. Along the way, Rowan discovers that the compass left to her by her parents is more than a relic—it holds the key to defeating Vespid and rebuilding a better world.

But victory comes at a price. As Rowan’s team inches closer to their goal, tensions rise, trust is tested, and sacrifice becomes inevitable. Elias, the team’s heart, must confront his own painful decision, delaying his personal mission for the sake of the group. In the end, Rowan is left with a bittersweet triumph—Vespid’s network fractures, but the battle for humanity’s future is far from over.

Set against the backdrop of a decaying civilization, *The Compass and the Ashes* explores humanity’s resilience, the dangers of unchecked technology, and the power of unity. Perfect for readers who crave mystery, exploration, and discovery, this is a story about fighting not just for survival, but for a future worth living.

Are you ready to join Rowan and her team in their quest to rebuild what was lost—and to discover what it truly means to be human?
